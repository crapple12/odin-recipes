    <h1>Baklava</h1>

    <h2>Baklava is a layered pastry dessert made of filo pastry, filled with chopped nuts, and sweetened with syrup or honey.</h2>
    <p>This dessert is normally prepared in large pans. Many layers of filo dough, separated with melted butter and vegetable oil, are laid in the pan. A layer of chopped nuts—typically walnuts or pistachios, but hazelnuts are also sometimes used—is placed on top, then more layers of filo. Most recipes have multiple layers of filo and nuts, though some have only top and bottom pastry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Phyllo Dough</em>. Make your own phyllo pastry dough or buy frozen phyllo dough at the store.</li>
      <li><em>Nuts</em>. Chopped walnuts, pistachios, or a mixture of both are traditionally used. Hazelnuts and/or pecans would also work.</li>
      <li><em>Butter</em>. Not only does butter add richness and flavor, it keeps the phyllo sheets moist and soft. It also helps the sheets stay together.</li>
      <li><em>Cinnamon</em>.Cinnamon is responsible for baklava's signature warmth.</li>
      <li><em>Water, Sugar, Vanilla, and Honey</em>. A sweet syrup — made from water, sugar, vanilla extract, and honey — is poured over the baked baklava layers, bringing the delicious dessert together.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Stack eight sheets of phyllo dough, brushing with butter between each layer, to create a sturdy base.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle it with a mixture of chopped nuts and cinnamon.</li>   
      <li>Top with two sheets of phyllo dough and follow with the nut mixture. Repeat this process a few more times, until the nut mixture is gone.</li>
      <li>Top with about eight more layers of phyllo, buttering each layer.</li>
      <li>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes. Be sure to cut all the way to the bottom of the pan.</li>
      <li>Bake until golden and crisp.</li>
      <li>Boil water and sugar until sugar is melted.</li>
      <li>Add vanilla and honey.</li>
      <li>Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour syrup over it.</li>
      <li>Let cool before serving.</li>   
    </ol>
